üëã **Hey!** Thanks for checking out my first post. I've recently been running a series of pairing workshops with my team covering a range of Software Design & Architecture patterns, and I thought it'd be useful to turn it into a bit of an online follow-along.

This is mainly focussed around many of the principles discussed in "the Blue Book" ([Domain-Driven Design](https://www.domainlanguage.com/), Evans, 2004) and later expanded on by V. Vernon in "the Red Book" ([Implementing Domain-Driven Design](https://vaughnvernon.com/), 2013). Though you don't need to read these as a pre-requisite to completing any of the challenges as part of this series, they explain some later principles far better than I ever could.

As with my code, please don't assume everything I'm writing up in these posts is correct and feel free to add comments; I'm still learning and all feedback is super useful! ‚ù§Ô∏è

## üåÑ background

For the past few months, I've been working with my team to deliver various features related to Customer Experience on a CMS-style platform. We've encountered many challenges along the way, and taken every opportunity to learn from them and keep growing - both individually and as a team.

As part of this, I've run a series of "Architecture & Software Design Patterns" pairing workshops as an alternative to trying to trick people into reading, and also allowing for people the opportunity to [learn and practice in the style that suits them best](https://bau.edu/blog/types-of-learning-styles/). üìñ

My hope is that this proves useful to _someone_; choose a pattern, pull down the repo & branch, have a bit of a laugh at the stupid story throughout, ask questions, make corrections, and **_keep learning_**.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è getting started

If you don‚Äôt know _anything_ about any of these patterns, don‚Äôt stress! The purpose of these challenges are to be an interactive introduction to each.

In this series, we'll follow along with (and at times take over) the perspective of _Bob_ - a simple ~being~ Engineer with great aspirations for automating his workplace. In our first challenge, we'll be looking at Python implementation of <ins>**[repositories]({{< ref "posts/repositories" >}})**</ins>... üè¶
